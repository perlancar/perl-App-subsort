0.049.1 2025-01-12  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: medium

        - [incompatible change] By defaultchomp the lines first and add
          output separator again later when printing, unless instructed not
          to by --no-chomp (-C).

          This also "fixes" sorting that does not seem to work, because newlines
          are accidentally included.
